Hello,

I am not too experienced with XFOIL so I am not to sure on how to find a NACA 6 series through the NACA search feature in XFOIL.
So I created the geometry of the NACA 63(3)-618 airfoil with http://airfoiltools.com/airfoil/details?airfoil=naca633618-il.
Also the MATLAB program needs to running in the same folder as the XFOIL executable.
